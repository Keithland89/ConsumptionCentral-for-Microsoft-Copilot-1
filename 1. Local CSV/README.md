# 1. Local CSV

**The quickest way to see it working.** Download your exports, put them in a folder, open the
template.

Works with Power BI Pro — no Fabric capacity needed. Bring whichever products you have; missing ones
just leave their pages empty.

---

## Three steps

### 1. Make a folder

Anywhere. `C:\Consumption Central\Data` is fine.

### 2. Put your exports in it

| Product | Where to get it |
|---|---|
| **Cowork / Work IQ** | Viva Insights → Analysis → build a query → download CSV |
| **Copilot Studio** | Power Platform admin centre → Licensing → Copilot Studio |
| **GitHub Copilot** | GitHub → Billing → AI usage report |
| **Azure AI Foundry** | Azure Cost Analysis → export, or run [`pull_azure_ai.py`](pull_azure_ai.py) |

File names don't have to match exactly — the template recognises the usual variations.

**[Full click-paths and permissions →](../docs/DATA-SOURCES.md)**

### 3. Open the template

Open **`Consumption Central - Local CSV.pbit`**, paste your folder path into `DataFolder`, click
**Load**.

That's it.

## Try it with sample data first

The **[sample-data](sample-data/)** folder holds a synthetic dataset covering all four products.
Point `DataFolder` at it and the whole report fills in — no exports needed.

## Department breakdowns

If your Viva query includes department or job title, they appear automatically. If it doesn't, add
them to the query in Viva Insights and re-run — easier than supplying a separate file.

## Next steps

- **Automate the Azure export** — schedule [`pull_azure_ai.py`](pull_azure_ai.py) instead of
  downloading by hand. **[How →](../docs/ADVANCED-SETUP.md#automating-azure-collection)**
- **Outgrown a folder?** **[2. Fabric](../2.%20Fabric/)** collects straight into Lakehouse tables and
  keeps history beyond Viva's 6-month export window.
