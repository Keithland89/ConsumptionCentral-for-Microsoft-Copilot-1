# 3. Viva Direct

**Cowork data with no download.** Connect straight to Viva Insights and let it refresh itself. The
other products and policy names still come from files, which are optional.

---

## Two things to paste

In Viva Insights:

1. **Analysis** → build a query with the Copilot credit metrics → turn on **Auto-refresh**
2. **Analysis results** → your query → the **link icon**
3. Copy the two identifiers

Open **`Consumption Central - Viva Direct.pbit`**, paste them in, click **Load**.

| | |
|---|---|
| **`VivaPartitionId`** | Partition identifier |
| **`VivaQueryId`** | Query identifier |

> **Leave the GitHub Copilot credit metric out of the query.** It makes the query fail in Viva
> Insights before Power BI is involved. Take GitHub usage from the GitHub export instead.

> **Build your own query under Analysis.** The Consumption Dashboard's "Connect data" dialog also
> hands out identifiers, but they point at a multi-table result this template can't request.

---

## Adding the other products *(optional)*

Set **`DataFolder`** to a folder holding whatever exports you have. Files are found by name, so
nothing needs renaming and anything you don't have is skipped.

| Product | Files it looks for |
|---|---|
| Copilot Studio | `StudioTenantDaily`, `StudioPerAgent`, `StudioPerUser` |
| GitHub Copilot | `GitHubAiUsage`, `GitHubUserMap` |
| Azure AI Foundry | `AzureAiSpendDaily`, `AzureAiTokensDaily` |
| Org attributes | `entra_org.csv` — for department breakdowns |

Leave `DataFolder` blank for consumption-only reporting. Leave pricing parameters at their defaults.

**[Where to get each one →](../docs/DATA-SOURCES.md)** ·
**[Automating the Azure files →](../docs/ADVANCED-SETUP.md#automating-azure-collection)**

---

## Department breakdowns need a directory CSV

Plan to supply one. Put `entra_org.csv` in your `DataFolder` with `UserPrincipalName` and the
attributes you want to group by — `Department`, `Organisation`, `JobTitle`. The identities must
match the consumption data.

Selecting attributes in the query UI does not guarantee the connector returns them, so check the
actual output before relying on a query-only setup.

**[Detail and edge cases →](../docs/ADVANCED-SETUP.md#org-attributes-on-viva-direct)**

---

## Policy names need one file

The connector gives you the policy **id** and its limits, but not the **name** — so unnamed policies
show as `Policy f1a2bfe2 — name not in export`.

To get the real names: Viva Insights → **Analysis results** → your query → **Download**, then drop
**`M365SpendingPolicyMetaData.csv`** into your `DataFolder`. Nothing else from that ZIP is needed.
The names appear on the next refresh.

---

## If the refresh fails

**`(500) Internal Server Error`** means the connector was asked for a multi-table export without a
table name. Check that `VivaPartitionId` and `VivaQueryId` point at a **custom query** built in
Analysis, not at a Consumption Dashboard export.

## Worth knowing

Microsoft ships its own Power BI template from the same dialog, covering Cowork consumption with
first-party support. This is a different proposition: four products in one report, with cost,
optimisation and forecast across all of them. Download both and see which you'd rather have.
